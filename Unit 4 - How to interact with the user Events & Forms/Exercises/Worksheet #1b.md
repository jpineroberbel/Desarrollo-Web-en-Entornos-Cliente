1. JS Guess the Color Game

  Coding a color guessing game with JavaScript is quite straightforward:

    1. You build a game where the player will see a single RGB value for a color.
    2. The player has to click on a color they think matches the RGB value displayed.
    3. You can easily add more features to the game to make it more difficult.

For example, you could limit the number of guesses or give the player three “lives”. With every wrong guess, they would lose one, and the game would be over when they run out of lives.
