If youâ€™re not familiar, the hangman game is about guessing a random word by guessing letters one by one. If the player runs out of guesses, the game is over.

Coding a JavaScript memory matching game or pairs game is another fun project you can build for fun (and for your portfolio!).

The logic of the game is simple:

There are a given number of cards on the table facing down.
The player needs to find all the pairs.
However, you may want to add more difficulty by limiting the number of guesses or by setting a time limit for the game to be finished.
