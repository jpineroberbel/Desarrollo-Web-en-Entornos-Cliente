# JS-Intro-OOP-Exercises

# Exercises

## Objectives:

* Get comfortable creating a class with properties and methods
* Practice creating objects and methods that interact with one another
* Instance several objects that are contained within a special container object
* Encapsulate functionality within the proper class

## Exercises:

### The Cat

_Write yourself a virtual cat - animals with a CLI are so much nicer than ones with fur._

*   Create an object that represents a cat. It should have properties for `tiredness`, `hunger`, `loneliness` and `happiness`
*   Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties. Call them something that actually represents what would increase or decrease these things, like "feed", "sleep", or "pet".
*   Last, write a method that prints out the cat's status in each area. (Be creative e.g. Paws is really hungry, Paws is VERY happy.) 
*   Bonus: Make the functions take arguments that increase or decrease arbitrary amounts
*   Bonus: Make the functions as arbitrary as cats are - sometimes make it so the cat doesn't _want_ to be petted.


### The Reading List

_An object-oriented book-list!_

*   Create a class `BookList`
*   Create another class called `Book`

*   **BookLists** should have the following properties:
	*   Number of books marked as read
	*   Number of books marked not read yet
	*   A reference to the next book to read (book object)
	*   A reference to the current book being read (book object)
	*   A reference to the last book read (book object)
	*   An array of all the Books
*   Each **Book** should have several properties:
	*   Title
	*  Genre
	*  Author
	*   Read (true or false)
	*   Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a [JS Date() object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
*   Every **Booklist** should have a few methods: 
	* .add(book)
		* should add a **book** to the books list.
	*   .finishCurrentBook()
		*   should mark the **book** that is currently being read as "read"
		*   Give it a read date of new Date(Date.now())
		*   Change the last **book** read to be the book that just got finished
		*   Change the current **book** to be the next book to be read
		*   Change the next **book** to be read property to be the first unread book you find in the list of books

*   **Booklists** and **Books** might need more methods than that. Try to think of more that might be useful.

### The Game (advanced)
Pick one of three games: Chess, Poker, or Roshambo (rock, paper, scissors). Roshambo is the easiest, followed by Poker, then Chess.

* Your game should have a **Game** object shat should be responsible for keeping track of it's state
	* State depends on the game, all games have players, but not all games have pieces, cards, or moves. try to plan out what your state will be first
	* Your game should keep a reference to **players**, and it should tell them whether or not they have won or lost
	* Your game should be able to look at the state of the players and execute a **turn**- this is where you put code that looks at the state of each player and evaluates the results of what happens when that player changes it's state
	* Some games will have multiple turns that will change the state of the game, while others (like roshambo) only have one turn that determines a win or a loss.
* You should have **Players** for your game, which should be a class
	* Each player should keep track of how many wins and losses it has
	* Players should keep track of their pieces, cards, or hands
* You should have a class for each **Piece**, **Card** or **Move**

It's up to you to do the rest of the design for this program! Ensure two players can be created in the console as classes, join a game, execute methods with moves, and one player can win each game.
